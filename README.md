## EfficientNet-Vit-Model-for-Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification

### 1. Background of the problem to be solved
Cassava, Africa's second-largest provider of carbohydrates, is a critical food security crop grown by smallholder farmers due to its ability to withstand harsh conditions. This starchy root is grown on at least 80% of Sub-Saharan African household farms, but viral diseases are a major source of low yields. It may be possible to identify common diseases and treat them using data science.


Existing disease detection methods necessitate farmers enlisting the assistance of government-funded agricultural experts to visually inspect and diagnose the plants. This suffers from being labor-intensive, scarce, and expensive. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under important constraints, as African farmers might only have access to low-bandwidth mobile-quality cameras.


The dataset for this competition consists of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. The majority of the images were crowdsourced from farmers who took photos of their gardens and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with Makerere University's AI lab in Kampala. This is in a format that most closely resembles what farmers would need to diagnose in the field. Our task is to categorize each cassava image into one of four disease categories or one healthy leaf category. To assist farmers in quickly identifying diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before irreversible damage occurs.
